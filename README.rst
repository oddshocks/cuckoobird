Cuckoobird
==========
A theme for the Chyrp blogging software
Based on Mockingbird by Nevan Scott (http://nevanscott.com/)

Themes
------

There exist in this repo two versions of Cuckoobird. The first is my initial
version, located in the master branch. The second is my newer iteration
and the one I am currently using on my blog. It is located in the
light-theme branch.

Development
-----------

I am basically working on this theme over time as I improve it on my own
website (oddshocks.com). I welcome contributions.

Have an excellent day.
